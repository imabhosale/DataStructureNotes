# imp DSA in computer science and programming.

-Optimized Performance: Efficient data structures and algorithms improve the 
  performance of software by making operations like searching, sorting,
 and accessing data faster.
-Efficient algorithms help in managing and utilizing resources such as
 CPU time and memory effectively.
-Learning DSA improves analytical thinking and problem-solving skills,
 enabling programmers to think logically about problem decomposition.
-Foundations for Advanced Topics such as artificial intelligence,
 machine learning, and robotics
-Understanding DSA helps in debugging and optimizing existing code, making
 it more robust and efficient.
-Writing efficient code often depends on choosing the right data structures and algorithms,
 leading to better code quality and maintainability.
-Everyday Applications: DSA concepts are used in real-world applications
 such as search engines,
 social networks, and recommendation systems.
- solid understanding of DSA helps in quickly learning and adapting to
 new programming languages,
 frameworks, and technologies, as the core principles remain consistent.


# Dive into arrays, their properties, and operations.
1) insert and delete the element in the array
-- to insert and delete the element we have to create a new array
   (for deletion it's ok to not display last element)
   but if we have to insert new element in full array after
 insertion last indexed element will not get seen.

# memory allocation in Array in Stack and heap

-Declaration: Defines the type and identifier of the array.
-Instantiation: Allocates memory in the heap using the new keyword.
-Initialization: Assigns values to the elements of the array.
-Arrays in Java are stored in contiguous memory locations in the heap,
 with a reference to the array object stored in the stack.
-Multi-dimensional arrays are arrays of arrays, with each sub-array allocated separately in the heap.


#Array Advantages and disadvantages

Arrays are a powerful tool for storing and accessing data efficiently,
 particularly when the number of elements is known in advance and does not change.
 They provide fast, direct access to elements and are simple to use and understand.
 However, their fixed size, inefficiency in insertion and deletion,
 and requirement for homogeneous elements can be limiting.

imp questions

1)Reverse the LL
2)delete the node in LL without given the head and (deleted node will not be last node)
3)middle of the LL (fast and slow pointer)
